# Real-Estate-Demographics

Welcome to our capstone project!  

Overview: 

Analysis of factors influencing a possible investment decision in a real estate purchase. Our question was in which region of Germany the supply of residential real estate will increase. In addition, we extended the analysis to include entertainment and income.
Starting point was the analysis of the demographic development in all federal states as well as different factors of influence in the real estate sector (e.g. number of apartments, prices) on the possible supply of residential real estate.
The basis of the analysis is the data provided by the Federal Statistical Office for the area of population and housing, from 2000 to 2050. In addition, data from individual providers (e.g. Tripadvisor) are included.
The main output are various evaluations of the individual anaylsed influencing factors in the corresponding regions. A data model, which weights the individual factors according to interest, calculates the corresponding location.
